The dungeon game was my final project during my first computer science course.
It was a 4 person group project and we decided to make a game. This game is
similar to certain RPG's that have random battles while exploring. I was 
responsible for creating the classes: EnemyData, WeaponData, and Potion. 
I also created the default map and the other mazes that can be selected at the
beginning of the game. This project has been one of my favorites since I even enjoyed,
testing the game along with implementing the different functions.
